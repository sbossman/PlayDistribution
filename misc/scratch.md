# Scratchpad
*Notes for when I'm coding again*

## To Do
1. Check if it made everything properly
2. Implement the "In scene" functionality
3. Implement "talks to" functionality
4. Figure out storing actual lines and whatnot
5. Figure out incorporating the "CORNELIUS/VOLTEMAND" line types
6. LORD [rest of lines] doesn't work
